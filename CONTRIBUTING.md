# How to contribute to really-simple-randomizer

This repo is a hobby project for an internal lottery, but is free to be used for other appropriate situations.

## Coding Standards

There are no explicit coding standards so pay attention to the general coding style, that's (mostly) used everywhere.

However, there's only one **REALLY** important rule: **use spaces for indenting** 😉.

## Forks and Branches

All contributions must be submitted as a [Pull Request (PR)](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) so you need to [fork this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) on your GitHub account.
